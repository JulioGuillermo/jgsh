# 🚀 JGSH: The Modern Block Terminal

JGSH is a modern TUI-based terminal wrapper written in Go. It intercepts shell sessions to organize command output into interactive, isolated "Blocks," providing IDE-grade syntax highlighting and a refined multi-line input experience.

## ✨ Key Features

- **📦 Block-Based Output**: Every command and its output are grouped into distinct, visually isolated cards.
- **🎨 IDE-Grade Syntax Highlighting**: Real-time Bash syntax highlighting powered by **Tree-sitter**.
- **⌨️ Multi-line Command Support**: Press `Shift+Enter` to insert newlines and write complex scripts directly in the prompt.
- **🔍 Smart Autocompletion**:
    - Context-aware suggestions (files, history, commands).
    - Navigate suggestions with `Up`/`Down` arrows.
    - Select with `Enter` or `Tab`.
- **📜 Persistent History**: searchable history across sessions with `Ctrl+R`.
- **⚡ Raw Mode Passthrough**: Automatic detection of full-screen TUI apps (vim, htop, etc.) for seamless native interaction.
- **🛡️ Secure Input**: Intelligent password prompt detection with automatic input masking.
- **🌀 Modern UI**: Built with the **Charm Bracelet** stack (Bubble Tea, Lipgloss, Bubbles).

## 🏗️ Architecture

JGSH follows a **Modular Hexagonal Architecture** (Ports and Adapters) to ensure high decoupling and testability:

- **`internal/sh`**: PTY management and shell interaction using `creack/pty`.
- **`internal/ui`**: TUI implementation using `charmbracelet/bubbletea`.
- **`internal/syntax`**: Syntax highlighting logic using `tree-sitter`.
- **`internal/completion`**: Autocompletion engine and history management.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **UI Framework**: [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea)
- **Styling**: [Lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss)
- **Parser**: [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter/go-tree-sitter)
- **Terminal Control**: [PTY](https://github.com/creack/pty)
